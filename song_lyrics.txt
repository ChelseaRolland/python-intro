"Freefall"
(Kaytranada feat. Durand Bernarr)

[Durand Bernarr:]
I just wanna let go, freefall
I don't wanna not trust no one
I just wanna let go, freefall
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Oh-oh, catch me baby, here I come
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me
Catch me, catch me

Here I go, take a chance
There's no more walls, arms wide open
No disguise, I'm too transparent
In my eyes, you see my lesson

I just wanna let go, freefall
(Just want to freefall)
I don't wanna not trust no one
(Not trust no one, alright)
I just wanna let go, freefall
(I just wanna free, yeah)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Oh)
Oh-oh, catch me baby, here I come

Taking my time
Trying something different
The choice is mine
And I choose to let you in (Ooh, babe)
I just gotta get used to it (Ooh, babe)
Then I'm gonna feel what love is

I just wanna let go, freefall
(I just wanna freefall, oh)
I don't wanna not trust no one
I just wanna let go, freefall
(I just wanna free, yeah, yeah)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Catch me)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Catch me, catch me)
Catch me, baby, here I come (Catch me, catch me)
Oh-oh, catch me baby, here I come

(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
(Oh-oh)
